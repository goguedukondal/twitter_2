This is my Twitter clone Application.
Here i used useState to manage state variables and keeps rendering page while updating the state variable.
This application works as same as twitter for some functionalies.It has three sections they are sidebar,home,and widgets.
Here side bar just static and home is dynamic where user can tweet. In this application i used redux to manage complex states and share data to required components.
In this application user can tweet image and something about image.In widgets section user can see some other user details (here clever progrmmer) and tweet .  It was not deploying on netlify and so attached screenshot [Screenshot (32)](https://github.com/goguedukondal/twitter_2/assets/97788201/f88a5e46-f2c4-4920-9b9a-371caf066ad7)

The Error while deploying is related to dependecies ![Screenshot (33)](https://github.com/goguedukondal/twitter_2/assets/97788201/9a36f7a8-e888-4020-a855-e0592d83799f)
